1. PERT - Program Evaluation and Review Technique
"In 1957, the Program Evaluation and Review Techique (PERT) was created to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris submarine project. One of the elements of PERT is the way that estimates are calculated. The scheme provides a very simple, but very effective way to convert estimates into probability distributions suitable for managers.
When you estimate a task, you provide three numbers. This is called trivariate analysis:
Optimistic Estimate, Nominal Estimate, Pessimistic Estimate. Given this three estimates, we can describe the probability distribution of the duration for a task.
